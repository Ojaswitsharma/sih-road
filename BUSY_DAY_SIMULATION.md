# 🚗 BUSY DAY TRAFFIC SIMULATION - NOW LIVE!

## ✅ What's Running Now

### **1000 VEHICLES** on the road! (250 of each type)
- 🛺 **250 Auto-rickshaws** (Yellow) - Rash, overtaking constantly
- 🏍️ **250 Motorcycles** (Red) - Erratic, weaving through traffic  
- 🚗 **250 Cars** (Gray) - Normal speed, stable
- 🚌 **250 Buses** (Blue) - Slow, steady

### **5,903 Potholes** with 99% speed reduction
- Vehicles slow to almost a stop!
- Dark gray color - highly visible
- All lanes affected - no escape!

### **2 Barricades** blocking lanes
- Yellow with black stripes
- Forces aggressive lane changes

### **Vehicles spawn every 2 seconds** = Heavy congestion!

## 🎯 Quick Stats Display Methods

### 1️⃣ **RIGHT-CLICK METHOD** (Easiest!)
```
Right-click any vehicle → "Show Parameter"
```
Shows: Type, Speed, Position, Lane, Route, Waiting Time, CO2

### 2️⃣ **VISUAL METHOD** (See speeds instantly!)
```
Press F9 → Vehicles tab → Color vehicles by: "speed"
```
- **Dark Red** = Stopped in pothole!
- **Yellow** = Medium speed
- **Green** = Fast/Normal

### 3️⃣ **NAME DISPLAY**
```
Press F9 → Vehicles tab → Check "Show vehicle name"
Increase size to 60-100
```
Shows vehicle IDs above each vehicle

## 🚦 What to Watch

### Traffic Chaos
- **Heavy congestion** from 1000 vehicles
- **Constant lane changes** by motorcycles and autos
- **Bottlenecks** at potholes (vehicles crawl through)
- **Emergency braking** when hitting potholes

### Pothole Effect
- Watch vehicles turn **dark red** when entering potholes
- Speed drops from 30+ km/h to ~0.3 km/h (99% reduction!)
- Traffic backs up behind slow vehicles

### Indian Driving Behavior
- **Motorcycles**: Zigzag between lanes constantly
- **Autos**: Aggressive overtaking, frequent lane changes
- **Cars**: Try to maintain lane but forced to move
- **Buses**: Slow and steady, block traffic

## 🎮 How to Use

### See Individual Vehicle Stats
1. **Right-click** any vehicle
2. **"Show Parameter"** 
3. See full stats window with:
   - Type (auto/motorcycle/car/bus)
   - Current speed (km/h)
   - Target speed
   - Position (x, y)
   - Lane ID
   - Waiting time
   - CO2 emissions

### Track a Vehicle Through Traffic
1. **Right-click** vehicle → **"Start Tracking"**
2. Camera follows it through the chaos
3. Watch it navigate potholes and lane changes
4. Press **ESC** to stop

### See All Speeds at Once
1. **Press F9**
2. **Vehicles tab**
3. **"Color vehicles by:"** → Select **"speed"**
4. Now the entire map shows speed visually!
   - Red zones = Congestion/Potholes
   - Green = Free flow

---

## 🔥 Pro Tips

1. **Zoom into congested areas** to see detailed interactions
2. **Color by speed** to identify traffic jams instantly
3. **Track a motorcycle** to see aggressive Indian driving
4. **Track a bus** to see how it creates bottlenecks
5. **Watch potholes** turn traffic dark red

## 🛠️ To Reduce Lag (if needed)

Edit `indian_road_sim.py` and change:
```python
("auto", 250),      # Change to 100
("motorcycle", 250), # Change to 100
("car", 250),       # Change to 100
("bus", 250)        # Change to 100
```

Then re-run: `python3 indian_road_sim.py`
