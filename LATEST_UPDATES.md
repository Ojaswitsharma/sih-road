# Latest Simulation Updates üöó

## Changes Made (October 6, 2025)

### ‚úÖ 1. Realistic Pothole Sizing
**Problem:** Potholes were way too big (5-8 meters) - unrealistic for Indian roads.

**Solution:** Implemented weighted size distribution matching real Indian road conditions:
- **70% Small potholes** (0.3-1.0m) - Most common
- **20% Medium potholes** (1.0-2.5m) - Occasional  
- **10% Large potholes** (2.5-5.0m) - Rare

These sizes now accurately reflect erratic Indian road conditions with small potholes being predominant.

### ‚úÖ 2. Increased Pothole Density
**Problem:** Only 4 potholes per road - not realistic.

**Solution:** 
- Now **8-12 potholes per road** at random positions
- Random placement (0.1-0.9 along road length) for realistic distribution
- Erratic irregular shapes with 8-point polygons

### ‚úÖ 3. More Barricades for Traffic Chaos
**Problem:** Only 15 barricades - not enough chaos.

**Solution:**
- Increased to **50 barricades** across the road network
- Yellow-black diagonal striped design (highly visible)
- Creates realistic route blocking and traffic congestion

### ‚úÖ 4. Speed Display on Vehicles
**Problem:** No visual feedback when vehicles go through potholes.

**Solution:**
- Added **real-time speed display** above all vehicles
- Shows current speed in km/h
- Visible when vehicles enter pothole zones (40% speed reduction)
- Large text size (50) for easy visibility

**View Settings Updated:**
```xml
vehicleName.show="1" 
vehicleText.show="1" 
vehicleText.param="speed" 
vehicleText.size="50"
```

### ‚úÖ 5. Black Lines Explained
**What are they?** The black lines where vehicles stop are **traffic light stop lines** at intersections.

**Details:**
- Automatically generated from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data
- Type: `traffic_light` junctions in the network
- Control traffic flow at major intersections
- Vehicles must obey traffic signals (red/yellow/green)
- This is realistic behavior for urban Indian roads

Examples in your simulation:
- Junction 267075196, 267259255, 6223295222, etc.
- Found at major road intersections throughout the map

## Summary of Indian Road Simulation Features

### Vehicle Types (4 types)
1. **üõ∫ Auto-rickshaw** (20%) - Yellow, nimble, low speed
2. **üèçÔ∏è Motorcycle** (40%) - Red, fast, aggressive lane changing  
3. **üöó Car** (30%) - Blue, moderate speed
4. **üöå Bus/Truck** (10%) - Green, slow, large

### Road Obstacles
- **Potholes**: 1,600-2,400 total (8-12 per road √ó 200 roads)
  - Mostly small (0.3-1.0m), some medium, few large
  - Dark gray color for visibility
  - 40% speed reduction zones
  
- **Barricades**: 50 total
  - Yellow with black diagonal stripes
  - 8m wide √ó 3m tall
  - Block lanes and create detours

- **Speed Breakers**: 20 total
  - Orange color
  - Speed reduction zones

- **Roadside Obstacles**: 30 total
  - Vendors (green)
  - Debris piles (gray)

### Visualization
- **Speed Display**: Shows current vehicle speed above each vehicle
- **Enhanced Colors**: Bright vehicle colors, visible obstacles
- **2-3x Size Exaggeration**: Easier to see all elements
- **Realistic Traffic Lights**: Stop lines at intersections

## How to Run
```bash
python3 osm_to_sim.py
```

The SUMO GUI will launch automatically with the enhanced "indian_roads" visualization scheme showing all speed values and realistic obstacle sizes.

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- [ ] Add speed reduction animation/color change when hitting potholes
- [ ] Implement vehicle damage simulation
- [ ] Add honking/sound effects at congestion points
- [ ] Create traffic density heatmaps
- [ ] Add emergency vehicle lanes
