U-TURN FIX: Minimum trip distance = 300m
```

## 🔧 Routing Improvements

### Problem: Buses Taking U-turns
**Root Cause**: Short trip distances and poor route selection

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Minimum Distance**: 300m (prevents immediate U-turns)
2. **Maximum Distance**: 3000m (realistic trip lengths)
3. **Better Algorithm**: A* routing (finds optimal paths)
4. **Loop Removal**: `--remove-loops` flag
5. **Route Repair**: `--repair` flag fixes broken routes
6. **Fringe Factor**: 10 (more edge-based traffic)
7. **Weight Randomization**: 1.5 (adds route variety)

### Enhanced Configuration
```xml
<processing>
    <collision.action value="warn"/>
    <time-to-teleport value="300"/> (5 min before teleport)
    <max-depart-delay value="900"/> (15 min max delay)
</processing>
<routing>
    <device.rerouting.probability value="0.3"/> (30% vehicles reroute)
    <device.rerouting.period value="300"/> (every 5 min)
</routing>
```

## 🎨 Visualization Features

### View Settings (mymap.view.xml)
- **Background**: Light green (0.8,0.9,0.8) - grass/earth tone

## 🚀 Running the Simulation

```bash
python3 osm_to_sim.py
```

### What Happens:
1. ✅ Converts OSM map to SUMO network
2. ✅ Generates polygons for buildings
3. ✅ Creates 4 vehicle types with distinct behavior
4. ✅ Generates visible potholes (12), barricades (8), speed breakers (5)
5. ✅ Adds roadside obstacles (vendors, parked vehicles, debris)
6. ✅ Creates enhanced visualization settings
7. ✅ Generates trips with minimum 300m distance (NO U-TURNS)
8. ✅ Routes vehicles using A* algorithm
9. ✅ Assigns vehicle types (Indian traffic mix)
10. ✅ Launches SUMO GUI with all features

## 🎮 In SUMO GUI

### To See Potholes:
1. **Zoom in** to road level
2. Look for **irregular brown/gray shapes** on the road surface
3. They appear as filled polygons (circles, ovals, irregular)
4. Watch vehicles **slow down** when passing over them

### To Verify Bus Fix:
1. Select a **blue bus/truck** vehicle
2. Click to follow it
3. Observe: Should travel **straight routes** (no immediate U-turns)
4. Minimum trip: 300m ensures realistic journeys

### Obstacle Locations:
- **Potholes**: Mid-road (30-70% along edge)
- **Barricades**: Mid-road (50% along edge)
- **Speed Breakers**: 40% along road
- **Roadside**: Edge of multi-lane roads

## 📈 Performance Settings

- **Step Length**: 0.1s (smooth simulation)
- **Collision Detection**: Warn mode (realistic)
- **Teleport Time**: 300s (realistic jam handling)
- **Rerouting**: 30% vehicles adapt to conditions

## 🌟 Realism Features

### Indian Road Characteristics:
✅ Mixed vehicle types (70% two/three wheelers)
✅ Visible road damage (potholes)
✅ Construction zones (barricades)
✅ Speed control (breakers)
✅ Roadside encroachment (vendors, parking)
✅ Aggressive motorcycles (weaving)
✅ Slow buses (proper routing)
✅ Traffic congestion
✅ Lane discipline issues

### Behavior Realism:
- Motorcycles: Cut through traffic, aggressive overtaking
- Auto-rickshaws: Squeeze into gaps, sudden maneuvers
- Cars: Standard behavior, some rule-following
- Buses: Stay in lane, slow acceleration, **NO U-TURNS**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Potholes Not Visible?
- **Zoom in closer** to road level
- Check layer visibility in SUMO GUI
- Look for irregular shapes (not just circles)
- Colors blend with road - look carefully

### Buses Still U-turning?
- Check trip distance in output
- Verify `--min-distance 300` was applied
- Check route file for trip length
- May need longer minimum distance (500m)

### Performance Issues?
- Reduce vehicle spawn rate (increase `-p` value)
- Reduce simulation time (`-e` value)
- Disable some obstacles
